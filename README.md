# Project Description

This project demonstrates how to automatically deploy a static website to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions. It includes:

- A simple static website with HTML and CSS files.
- A GitHub Actions workflow that triggers on code changes in the main branch.
- Automated deployment of the website files to the `gh-pages` branch.
- Hosting the site live and free on GitHub Pages, allowing anyone to access it via a public URL.

It showcases an easy and automated way to build and publish websites directly from a GitHub repository without manual uploads or external hosting services.
